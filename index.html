                    <p>
                        My name is Jayden Yiu, a Grade 10 student at UHS with a strong passion for STEM. I've gained experience in coding, robotics, 
                        and competitions like the Canadian Computing Competition and the Pascal Math Contest. I'm an active member of the UHS Robotics Team,
                         the Markham Firebirds, and the UHS Computer Science Club.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I'm a Canadian immigrant from Hong Kong, fluent in English, Cantonese, and Mandarin. I've lived in Canada for four years and 
                        am currently part of the STEM program at UHS, where I participate in robotics, computer design, and computer science. 
                        As a member of the UHS Robotics team, I contribute to autonomous routines and other programming tasks. In my free time, 
                        I enjoy gaming, modding games, playing piano, web/app development, and solving coding challenges on LeetCode. I have experience 
                        with Java, Python, C++, HTML/CSS, and JavaScript.
